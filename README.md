        - added '.belongsToMany()' relationship with 'models.Person' as the "many"...
        - 'as' is the alias; if this is ommitted, Sequelize tries it's best to pluralize your model
          name--in this case, it would have associated 'Person' with 'People'--this is important for later...
        - 'through' is required; 'through' defines the name of the JOIN table that Sequelize uses to relate
          two tables
          !! IMPORTANT: the many-to-many tables must have the same 'through' value; they're sharing the same JOIN table person.js

app.js
    - line-19,20
        - added two more movie global variables for variety; not needed
        
    - line-79,88
        - added the two new movie records to the Movie table
        
    - line-95
        - added the two new global movie variables to the destructuring method
        
    - line-98,102
        - here is where we add the actual relationship between the two tables...
                movie(s) <---JOIN_table---> actor(s)

            !! IMPORTANT: when you create a many-to-many relationship, as we did on line 29 of movie.js and person.js, Sequelize
            automatically creates "Magic" functions... basically Setters and Getters
            To view a list of these, console log the following "console.log(Object.keys(currentUser.__proto__));"

            - we use the '.addActors()' method to add instances of the 'Person' model to specific movie instances; the method name is 
            auto-generated by Sequelize using that 'through' value we talked about above; if we did not include a 'through' value, the
            method would have been named ".addPeople()"

            NOTE: it's important that you return the result(Promise) of this addition process; I tried adding 'Person(s)' to
            movies, then returning a resolved Promise object and the additions didn't bind. Make sure to use Promise.all()

        - the rest is regular querying...    
        - 'model' is the type for the value of array objects in the many-to-many relationship, in this case it's 'Person'
        - 'as' is the alias we used for the many-to-many property/key, in this case it's 'actors'

        - the rest is regular querying...
        - 'model' is the type for the value of array objects in the many-to-many relationship, in this case it's 'Movie'
        - 'as' is the alias we used for the many-to-many property/key, in this case it's 'movies'

*Lastly,
    I've commented out some console.log statements in the original app.js just to reduce clutter on the console output.
    The important logs remain-- Movies.findAll() and Person.findAll()
